# Handbell Hero

It's like guitar hero...but with handbells! (Except in this case you can use your phone!)

```Based heavily off of a java project done by Ben Peter.```

Instructions
1. Go to [the main website](https://singerbj.github.io/handbell-hero) on your computer/tv.
2. Go to [the bell website](https://singerbj.github.io/handbell-hero/bell) on your phone. (It is most optimal to have at least 7 phones at once - one for each color)
3. Play a song and tap your phone screen to make music!
